- 👋 Hi, I’m Samuel E. I'm a python developer focusing on data acquisition particularly from online sources(web scraping) and delivering the data to databases(relational/non-relational) or any other desired format.
- 👀 I’m interested in eventually developing intelligent tools based off of machine learning and AI. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about various machine learning algorithms using Python's Sci-kit learn, keras and tensorflow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on major web scraping projects and also machine learning/AI projects.
